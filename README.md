# HTML-CSS Projects
Hello!


I have recently begun my Web development journey as well as knowing more about IT during mid 2022. I would like to have this README document to be evidence of why I started to get into the sector and hopefully be proficient at it regardless of whether I end up in a Web dev career or not. 

My goals include:

+ Complete FCC, TOP and CS50
+ Basic cyber security knowledge
+ Basic game dev knowledge
+ Have a nice Portfolio by the end of 2023

Methods:
+ Minimum 1hr of coding per day

-----------------------------------------------------------------

This repository will be used for all practice projects that are related to HTML/CSS (FCC)
