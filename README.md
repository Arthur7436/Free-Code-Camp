# HTML/CSS/JavaScript Projects
Hello!

I have recently started to gain interest within the IT sector around mid 2022 and began to get my hands dirty by attempting to know basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

I would like to have this README document to be evidence (as well as keeping a timeline of my projects) of why I started to get into the sector. I aspire to direct myself more towards the Front end developing pathway after being comfortable with using VSCode/Git/Github etc... along with understanding how coding languages work.

My goals include:

+ Complete Free Code Camp (FCC), The Odin Project (TOP) and CS50
+ Basic cyber security knowledge (In my downtime)
+ Basic game dev knowledge (In my downtime)
+ Have a nice Portfolio by the end of 2023
+ Basic Cloud knowledge + projects

Methods:
+ Minimum 1hr study per day
+ A lot of googling :3
