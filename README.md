# Free Code Camp Projects
Hello friend! Thanks for visiting my first ever repository :D

I have recently started to gain serious interest towards the IT sector around mid 2022 and began to get my hands dirty by attempting to know HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript.

I would like to have this README document to be evidence of why I started to get into the sector. I aspire to direct myself more towards the Front end developing pathway after being comfortable with using VSCode/Git/Github etc... along with understanding how coding languages work. I would like to utilise FreeCodeCamp's online curriculum to expose myself to the in-demand skills that are required to work in front end.
