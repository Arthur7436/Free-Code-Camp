Hello!

I have recently begun my Web development journey as well knowing more about IT during mid 2022. I would like to have this README document to be evidence of why I started to get into the sector and hopefully be proficient at it. 
My goals include:

+ Complete FCC, TOP and CS50
+ Basic cyber security knowledge
+ Basic game dev knowledge
+ Have a nice Portfolio :D

Methods:
+ Code/learn relevant topics at least 1 hour/day :D

Due date: Dec 2024
